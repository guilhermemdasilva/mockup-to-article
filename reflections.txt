You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* With these first classes and project, I learned a few html tags I didn't know before. 
* Until now everything is going very smoothly. 
* I faced no difficulties yet, maybe a couple of mistakes due to not paying attention to details. 
* For sure I used the problem solving strategies. Always looking for documentation and forums to learn how things work before testing anything.
